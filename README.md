List of bioinformatics resources everyone can use:

### Genome Data Sources

* [Personal Genome Project](https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data) - Crowdsourced list of mostly-anonymous human genomes contributed by site users. Includes Whole Genome Sequences as well as variant VCF files (mostly Ancestry.com and 23andme)
* [1000 Genomes, by the International Genome Sample Resource](ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/) - More than 2500+ genomes from the European Bioinformatics Institute. Includes genomes from all continents.

### Reference Genomes

* [UCSC Genome Browser](https://genome-asia.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) - Provides complete reference genomes (FASTA) for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, fruitfly, worm, and yeast species.
* [NCBI ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) - Aggregator for genes linked to human health and disease.

### Genome Analysis & Data Manipulation

* [Genetic Genie Genvue](https://genvue.geneticgenie.org/) - A tool that allows you to generate a genetic report anonymously by uploading WGS VCF files, or 23andme & ancestry "raw data".
* [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) - A tool for in-depth analysis and data manipulation of genetic data, collecting many tools in one data platform.
* [Meme](http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme) - Motif discovery tool.
* [Homer](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/motif/) - Another motif discovery tool.
* [Consensus](http://stormo.wustl.edu/consensus/html/Html/main.html) - Yet another motif discovery tool.
* [Weblogo 3](http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/) - Sequence visualizer
